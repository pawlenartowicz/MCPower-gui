Acknowledgments

To Maja Willard (Wójcik) — for her extraordinary patience
and unwavering support through the hundreds of hours
I poured into this "weekend project."

The quotes around "weekend project" exist because we both know 
it turned into something far beyond a single weekend (or ten).

She endured late nights, vacant stares when she asked me
perfectly normal questions, absent-minded dinner conversations
about bugs and features, and my endless "just three more minutes"
— which, as we both know, never once meant three minutes.

She watched me celebrate fixing a bug at 3 AM like Man Utd just 
won Champions Legue, only to discover a new one by 3:05.

Through all of it, she stayed patient, encouraging, and kind
— and only occasionally gave me that look when I opened
my laptop again.

She is the real hero behind this app, and no amount of
commit messages could express how much that means to me.
