# Find Sample Size

Search for the minimum sample size that achieves the target power.

- **From** — Starting sample size (default 30).
- **To** — Maximum sample size to try (default 200).
- **Step** — Increment between sample sizes (default 10).
- Click **Find Sample Size** to start.

The search evaluates power at each sample size in the range and reports the first sample size where each target test reaches the target power. Results include a power curve showing how power increases with sample size.

## Running an analysis

Both buttons are disabled until a valid formula with at least one predictor is entered in the Model tab. While an analysis is running, a progress dialog shows the current simulation count. You can click **Abandon** in the progress dialog to cancel the analysis.
