# Correlations (optional)

If you have two or more continuous or binary predictors, a correlation triangle appears. Each pair gets a spin box for the Pearson correlation (range -1.0 to 1.0). Factor variables and interactions are excluded from the correlation matrix.

Correlations are used in the Cholesky decomposition during data generation to produce correlated predictor variables.
