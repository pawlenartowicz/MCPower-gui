# Input Mode

Choose between two modes for defining your model:

- **Linear Formula** — Enter an R-style formula (e.g. `y = x1 + x2 + x1:x2`). You control variable types (continuous, binary, factor) and correlations manually. Suitable for regression models with mixed predictor types.
- **ANOVA** — Define factors and their levels directly. All predictors are treated as categorical factors. Correlations are not applicable in ANOVA mode.

The input mode toggle switches the visible sections below: Linear Formula mode shows the Model Formula and Variable Types sections, while ANOVA mode shows the ANOVA Factors section.
