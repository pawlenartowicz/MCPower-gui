# Effect Sizes

Each predictor (after factor expansion) gets a row with:

- A **spin box** for the standardized effect size (range -2.0 to 2.0).
- A **sign toggle** button to flip the sign.
- **S / M / L** buttons that set the value to a conventional effect size:

| Type | Small (S) | Medium (M) | Large (L) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Continuous | 0.10 | 0.25 | 0.40 |
| Binary | 0.20 | 0.50 | 0.80 |
| Factor | 0.20 | 0.50 | 0.80 |

The S/M/L buttons preserve the current sign (positive or negative). When the window is wide enough, the buttons expand to show full labels (small / medium / large).
